# Description

A simple LLM chatbot creation using Facebook’s Blenderbot model and Hugging Face’s Python library, Transformers.
To build the web application two main steps were  implemented:<br />
      - A back-end server that hosts the chatbot<br />
      - A front-end webpage that communicates with the back-end server

In the chatbot application, the back-end server receives the prompts from the front-end interface and feeds them to the chatbot, which processes the prompts.
Web interface was built using Flask Framework.
